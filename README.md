# Audio_Adversarial_Attack_Example_ReImpletation

This project is inspired by the works of Nicholas Carlini on the Implementation of creating Adversarial Attack Sample on DeepSpeech.

Link to the original paper : https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01944

Instruction for Original Implementation can be found [here](orig_impl/readme.md).

I have worked towards a somewhat better implementation, which works with a later version of DeepSpeech as well. Instructions for the same can be found [here](deepspeech_v0.9.3/readme.md).

Will update the readme as I go through more.
